We apply any payments made in the following order:\n• to reduce sums shown on the most recent monthly statement, according to their interest rates, with the highest rate paid first; and\n• if any payment exceeds the most recent monthly statement balance, the excess will then be applied to reduce sums charged to the Card but not yet shown on any monthly statement. This is also done according to interest rates, with the highest interest rate paid first. If parts of either of the balances referred to above have the same interest rate, sums on which interest is charged on interest will reduce first.\nWe may give written notice allowing the customer not to make a minimum payment.

We may not issue a monthly statement if the balance is zero and there have been no entries since the previous monthly statement. The minimum payment must be made each month from a business account in the customers' name. The minimum payment will be the greater of (i) £5 or the full balance if less; or (ii) that month's interest, any Default Charges, 1/12th of any annual fee and 3% of the remaining balance (excluding any annual fee).   Any overdue amounts, which will be included in the total amount required to pay, are payable immediately. When we ask, immediate payment is required on any amount you owe over the Business Credit Limit. We encourage customers to pay more than the minimum amount each month. As they will clear their balance more quickly and pay less interest. Customers must not make payments to their Card that creates a positive balance on your account. We may return any credit balance or apply it to a current account.."

We use any payments we receive to pay off: • any overdue amounts from previous monthly statements; • any minimum payment; and • any overlimit amount on the Card. Customers can’t choose how a payment is applied to their Card. We apply any payments made in the following order: • to reduce sums shown on the most recent monthly statement, according to their interest rates, with the highest rate paid first; and • if any payment exceeds the most recent monthly statement balance, the excess will then be applied to reduce sums charged to the Card but not yet shown on any monthly statement. This is also done according to interest rates, with the highest interest rate paid first. If parts of either of the balances referred to above have the same interest rate, sums on which interest is charged on interest will reduce first. We may give written notice allowing the customer not to make a minimum payment. If so, interest will still accrue."
