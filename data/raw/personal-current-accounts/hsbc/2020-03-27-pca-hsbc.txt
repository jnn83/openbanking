For example, if you saved £250 every month for 12 months a total of £3000 will be paid in to your account during the 12 month term. At 5% you would earn approximately £81 interest (gross). Partial withdrawals are not allowed during the 12 month term. If you close your Regular Saver before the anniversary, we will pay interest at the same rate as we would apply to an equivalent amount held in a Flexible Saver. You can only hold one Regular Saver at any given time. AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate. This shows you what the gross rate would be if interest were paid and compounded each year. All credit interest will be paid gross. Gross is the rate of interest if interest were paid and not compounded each year."

Save between £25 and £250 per month by standing order from your HSBC Advance Bank Account for a fixed term of 12 months. If you do not save £250 in any given month you can carry over any unused subscription to following months. Interest is calculated on the daily cleared balance on your 'Regular Saver and we will pay this to your Regular Saver on the anniversary of the date your account was opened. For example, if you saved £250 every month for 12 months a total of £3000 will be paid in to your account during the 12 month term. At 2.75% you would earn approximately £44 interest (gross). Partial withdrawals are not allowed during the 12 month term. If you close your Regular Saver before the anniversary, we will pay interest at the same rate as we would apply to an equivalent amount held in a Flexible Saver. You can only hold one Regular Saver at any given time. AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate. This shows you what the gross rate would be if interest were paid and compounded each year. All credit interest will be paid gross. Gross is the rate of interest if interest were paid and not compounded each year"

Save between £25 and £250 per month by standing order from your HSBC Advance Bank Account for a fixed term of 12 months. If you do not save £250 in any given month you can carry over any unused subscription to following months. Interest is calculated on the daily cleared balance on your 'Regular Saver and we will pay this to your Regular Saver on the anniversary of the date your account was opened. For example, if you saved £250 every month for 12 months a total of £3000 will be paid in to your account during the 12 month term. At 2.75% you would earn approximately £44 interest (gross). Partial withdrawals are not allowed during the 12 month term. If you close your Regular Saver before the anniversary, we will pay interest at the same rate as we would apply to an equivalent amount held in a Flexible Saver. You can only hold one Regular Saver at any given time. AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate. This shows you what the gross rate would be if interest were paid and compounded each year. All credit interest will be paid gross. Gross is the rate of interest if interest were paid and not compounded each year"
